# Compiler-Parser
Compiler Construction Lab

This project is part of the **Compiler Construction Lab** with Instructor **Mr. Laeeq Khan Niazi**. The goal of the lab is to create and progressively improve a Parser using **STL in C++**. The project includes handling custom language features, error reporting, and implementing new data types, keywords, and control structures.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Command Line File Input (Lab 1)
- Modify the code to accept a file name as a command line argument for parsing.
  
### 2. Human-Friendly Error Messages
- Improve error reporting by displaying human-friendly messages, including the line number of the error.

### 3. Support for More Data Types
- Add support for `float`, `double`, `string`, `bool`, and `char` data types.

### 4. Additional Keywords
- Expand the language by introducing more custom keywords.

### 5. Custom Conditional Statements
- Change the syntax of conditional statements. For example, replace `if` with a custom keyword like `Agar`.

### 6. Looping Constructs
- Add support for loop structures like `while` and `for`.

### 7. Logical Expressions in Conditions
- Introduce logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`) for use in `if` conditions.

### 8. Symbol Table
- Implement a symbol table using an efficient data structure (like a hash map or binary search tree) to track variable declarations, data types, and scope information.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ STL and file handling.

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-parser.git
   
2. Compile the code:
  ``g++ -o parser parser.cpp

3. Run the parser with a source file:
  ``./parser your-source-file.txt
